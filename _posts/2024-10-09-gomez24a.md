title: Improving Transfer Learning by means of Ensemble Learning and Swarm Intelligence-based
  Neuroevolution
openreview: VgnII4nq9k
abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, when applied to very small but
  complex datasets, tend to overfit on the validation partitions and underperform
  compared to Transfer Learning models. In order to reduce the bias and variance of
  their predictions, Deep Ensemble Learning (DEL) can be used. The combination of
  NAS and DEL has only been employed on large datasets in the literature, but these
  scenarios do not present the overfitting in validation we typically experience,
  for instance, on medical imaging applications. In this work, we empirically assess
  the feasibility of NAS, DEL and the combination of the two on both small and large
  dataset scenarios. We find that the performance of the ensembles highly depend on
  the degree of overfitting of the standalone models, but always will outperform the
  worst generalizing models in the population.
