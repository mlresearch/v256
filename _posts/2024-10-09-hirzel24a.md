title: Training and Cross-Validating Machine Learning Pipelines with Limited Memory
openreview: 4LkaPSHUQQ
abstract: 'While automated machine learning (AutoML) can save human labor in finding
  well-performing pipelines, it often suffers from two problems: overfitting and using
  excessive resources.  Unfortunately, the solutions are often at odds: cross-validation
  helps reduce overfitting at the expense of more resources; conversely, preprocessing
  on a separate compute cluster and then cross-validating only the final predictor
  saves resources at the expense of more overfitting.  This paper shows how to train
  and cross-validate entire pipelines on a single moderate machine with limited memory
  by using monoids, which are associative, thus providing a flexible way for handling
  large data one batch at a time.  To facilitate AutoML, our approach is designed
  to support the common sklearn APIs used by many AutoML systems for pipelines, training,
  cross-validation, and several operators.  Abstracted behind those APIs, our approach
  uses task graphs to extend the benefits of monoids from operators to pipelines,
  and provides a multi-backend implementation.  Overall, our approach lets users train
  and cross-validate pipelines on simple and inexpensive compute infrastructure.'
