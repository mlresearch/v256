title: Automated Deep Learning for load forecasting
openreview: i8o3xQnfmV
abstract: Accurate forecasting of electricity consumption is essential to ensure the
  performance and stability of the grid, especially as the use of renewable energy
  increases. Forecasting electricity is challenging because it depends on many external
  factors, such as weather and calendar variables. While regression-based models are
  currently effective, the emergence of new explanatory variables and the need to
  refine the temporality of the signals to be forecasted is encouraging the exploration
  of novel methodologies, in particular deep learning models. However, Deep Neural
  Networks (DNNs) struggle with this task due to the lack of data points and the different
  types of explanatory variables (e.g. integer, float, or categorical). In this paper,
  we explain why and how we used Automated Deep Learning (AutoDL) to find performing
  DNNs for load forecasting. We ended up creating an AutoDL framework called EnergyDragon
  by extending the DRAGON (\url{https://dragon-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/})
  package and applying it to load forecasting. EnergyDragon automatically selects
  the features embedded in the DNN training in an innovative way and optimizes the
  architecture and the hyperparameters of the networks. We demonstrate on the French
  load signal that EnergyDragon can find original DNNs that outperform state-of-the-art
  load forecasting methods as well as other AutoDL approaches.
