title: Analyzing Few-Shot Neural Architecture Search in a Metric-Driven Framework
openreview: ePH3xBFOiP
abstract: While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods help find optimal neural
  network architectures for diverse tasks, they often come with unreasonable costs.
  To tackle such a drawback, the one-shot NAS setting was introduced, where a supernet
  is used as a superposition of all architectures in the space and performs the search
  in a single training phase. While this method significantly reduces the cost of
  running NAS, the joint optimization of every architecture degrades the performance
  of the search. The few-shot NAS line of work tackles this issue by splitting the
  supernet into sub-supernets trained separately, each with a reduced level of weight-sharing,
  which gives rise to the new challenge of finding the best way to split the supernet.
  In particular, GM-NAS utilizes a gradient matching score to group operations in
  a splitting schema. We extend and generalize this method by building a framework
  with compatibility for any arbitrary architecture evaluation metric, enabling the
  generation of numerous and diverse splits. We leverage this new framework in conjunction
  with various metrics from the zero-shot NAS literature and investigate the benefits
  of splitting across algorithms and metrics. We find that architectures are distributed
  in disadvantageous ways inside splits, and that proposed supernet selection methods
  are flawed.
