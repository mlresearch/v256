title: Sequence Alignment-based Similarity Metric in Evolutionary Neural Architecture
  Search
openreview: Nr1BYwtxMj
abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful method for automating
  the design of deep neural networks across diverse applications, with evolutionary
  optimization showing particular promise in addressing its intricate demands. However,
  the effectiveness of this approach highly depends on balancing exploration and exploitation,
  ensuring that the search does not prematurely converge to suboptimal solutions while
  still achieving near-optimal outcomes. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing
  a novel similarity metric inspired by global sequence alignment from biology. Unlike
  most of the existing methods that require pre-trained models for comparison, our
  metric operates directly on neural network architectures within the defined search
  space, eliminating the need for model training. We outline the computation of the
  normalized similarity metric and demonstrate its application in quantifying diversity
  within populations in evolutionary NAS. Experimental results conducted on popular
  datasets for image classification, such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120,
  show the effectiveness of our approach in guiding diversity based on our suggested
  control function. Additionally, we highlight the usefulness of our similarity metric
  in comparing individuals to identify advantageous or disadvantageous architectural
  design choices. The code is available at \url{https://anon-github.automl.cc/r/evonas_similarity_metric-1BD3/}.
