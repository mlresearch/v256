title: 'Introducing HoNCAML: Holistic No-Code Auto Machine Learning'
openreview: XsmfpPUYvq
abstract: In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has been changing the landscape of
  many industries, demanding companies to incorporate ML solutions to stay competitive.
  In response to this imperative, and with the aim of making this technology more
  accessible, the emergence of “no-code” AutoML assumes critical significance. This
  paper introduces HoNCAML (Holistic No-Code Auto Machine Learning), a new AutoML
  library designed to provide an extensive and user-friendly resource accommodating
  individuals with varying degrees of coding proficiency and diverse levels of ML
  expertise, inclusive of non-programmers. The no-code principles are implemented
  through a versatile interface offering distinct modalities tailored to the proficiency
  of the end user. The efficacy of HoNCAML is comprehensively assessed through qualitative
  comparisons with analogous libraries, as well as quantitative performance benchmarks
  on several public datasets. The results from our experiments affirm that HoNCAML
  not only stands as an accessible and versatile tool, but also ensures competitive
  performance across a spectrum of ML tasks.
