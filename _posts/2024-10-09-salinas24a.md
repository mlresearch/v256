title: 'TabRepo: A Large Scale Repository of Tabular Model Evaluations and its AutoML
  Applications'
openreview: 03V2bjfsFC
abstract: We introduce TabRepo, a new dataset of tabular model evaluations and predictions.
  TabRepo contains the predictions and metrics of 1206 models evaluated on 200 regression
  and classification datasets. We illustrate the benefit of our datasets in multiple
  ways. First, we show that it allows to perform analysis such as comparing Hyperparameter
  Optimization against current AutoML systems while also considering ensembling at
  no cost by using precomputed model predictions. Second, we show that our dataset
  can be readily leveraged to perform transfer-learning. In particular, we show that
  applying standard transfer-learning techniques allows to outperform current state-of-the-art
  tabular systems in accuracy, runtime and latency.
