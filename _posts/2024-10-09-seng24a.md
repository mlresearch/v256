title: Bi-Level One-Shot Architecture Search for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting
openreview: AaPhnfFQYn
abstract: Time series forecasting is ubiquitous in many disciplines. A recent hybrid
  architecture named predictive Whittle networks (PWNs) tackles this task by employing
  two distinct modules, a tractable probabilistic model and a neural forecaster, with
  the former guiding the latter by providing likelihoods about predictions during
  training. Although PWNs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, finding the optimal type
  of probabilistic model and neural forecaster (macro-architecture search) and the
  architecture of each module (micro-architecture search) of such hybrid models remains
  difficult and time-consuming. Current one-shot neural architecture search (NAS)
  methods approach this challenge by focusing on either the micro or the macro aspect,
  overlooking mutual impact, and could attain the overall optimization only sequentially.
  To overcome these limitations, we introduce a bi-level one-shot NAS method that
  optimizes such hybrid architectures simultaneously, leveraging the relationships
  between the micro and the macro architectural levels. We empirically demonstrate
  that the hybrid architectures found by our method outperform human-designed and
  overparameterized ones on various challenging datasets. Furthermore, we unveil insights
  about underlying connections between architectural choices and temporal features.
