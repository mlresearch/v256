title: 'HPO-RL-Bench: A Zero-Cost Benchmark for HPO in Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: MlB61zPAeR
abstract: Despite the undeniable importance of optimizing the hyperparameters of RL
  algorithms, existing state-of-the-art Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) techniques
  are not frequently utilized by RL researchers. To catalyze HPO research in RL, we
  present a new large-scale benchmark that includes pre-computed reward curve evaluations
  of hyperparameter configurations for six established RL algorithms (PPO, DDPG, A2C,
  SAC, TD3, DQN) on 22 environments (Atari, Mujoco, Control), repeated for multiple
  seeds. We exhaustively computed the reward curves of all possible combinations of
  hyperparameters for the considered hyperparameter spaces for each RL algorithm in
  each environment. As a result, our benchmark permits zero-cost experiments for deploying
  and comparing new HPO methods. In addition, the benchmark offers a set of integrated
  HPO methods, enabling plug-and-play tuning of the hyperparameters of new RL algorithms,
  while pre-computed evaluations allow a zero-cost comparison of a new RL algorithm
  against the tuned RL baselines in our benchmark.
