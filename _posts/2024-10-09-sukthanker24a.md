title: Weight-Entanglement Meets Gradient-Based Neural Architecture Search
openreview: 4klsxqPerv
abstract: Weight sharing is a fundamental concept in neural architecture search (NAS),
  enabling gradient-based methods to explore cell-based architectural spaces significantly
  faster than traditional blackbox approaches. In parallel, weight entanglement has
  emerged as a technique for more intricate parameter sharing amongst macro-architectural
  spaces. Since weight-entanglement is not directly compatible with gradient-based
  NAS methods, these  two paradigms have largely developed independently in parallel
  sub-communities. This paper aims to bridge the gap between these sub-communities
  by proposing a novel scheme to adapt gradient-based methods for weight-entangled
  spaces. This enables us to conduct an in-depth comparative assessment and analysis
  of the performance of gradient-based NAS in weight-entangled search spaces. Our
  findings reveal that this integration of weight-entanglement and gradient-based
  NAS brings forth the various benefits of gradient-based methods, while preserving
  the memory efficiency of weight-entangled spaces. The code for our work is openly
  accessible at \url{https://anon-github.automl.cc/r/TangleNAS-5BA5}.
