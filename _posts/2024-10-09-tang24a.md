title: 'AutoGluon-Multimodal (AutoMM): Supercharging Multimodal AutoML with Foundation
  Models'
openreview: irStSm9waW
abstract: AutoGluon-Multimodal (AutoMM) is introduced as an open-source AutoML library
  designed specifically for multimodal learning. Distinguished by its exceptional
  ease of use, AutoMM enables fine-tuning of foundational models with just three lines
  of code. Supporting various modalities including image, text, and tabular data,
  both independently and in combination, the library offers a comprehensive suite
  of functionalities spanning classification, regression, object detection, semantic
  matching, and image segmentation. Experiments across diverse datasets and tasks
  showcases AutoMMâ€™s superior performance in basic classification and regression tasks
  compared to existing AutoML tools, while also demonstrating competitive results
  in advanced tasks, aligning with specialized toolboxes designed for such purposes.
