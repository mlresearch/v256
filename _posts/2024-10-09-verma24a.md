title: 'ASML: A Scalable and Efficient AutoML Solution for Data Streams'
openreview: 9fL1HaSW6X
abstract: Online learning poses a significant challenge to AutoML, as the best model
  and configuration may change depending on the data distribution. To address this
  challenge, we propose Automated Streaming Machine Learning (ASML), an online learning
  framework that automatically finds the best machine learning models and their configurations
  for changing data streams. It adapts to the online learning scenario by continuously
  exploring a large and diverse pipeline configuration space. It uses an adaptive
  optimisation technique that utilizes the current best design, adaptive random directed
  nearby search, and an ensemble of best performing pipelines. We experimented with
  real and synthetic drifting data streams and showed that ASML can build accurate
  and adaptive pipelines by constantly exploring and responding to changes. In several
  datasets, it outperforms existing online AutoML and state-of-the-art online learning
  algorithms.
